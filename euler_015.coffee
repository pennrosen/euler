# Problem 15
# ==========
# 
# Starting in the top left corner of a 2 * 2 grid, there are 6 routes
# (without backtracking) to the bottom right corner.
# 
# How many routes are there through a 20 * 20 grid?

# Hey, that's the binomial coefficient! Thank you high school geometry.
#	Formula is (2n)! / (n!)^2 where n == 20
#	I used WolframAlpha :)
